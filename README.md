# toolbox
This is a toolbox for personal uses, including jenkins dockerfile and build script for two static analyzers 
such as [IKOS](https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/ikos) and [cppcheck](https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck).
Both of static analyzers are based on LLVM-11 for RISC-V 64-bit architecture.
